1. What are the various ways to add images into our app? Explain with code examples.
- a. using <img> tag : we can add an image to app by using an <img> tag, and specifying the source of
image using the src attribute.

import React from "react";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <img src="image.jpg" />
        </>
    )
}

export default App;

 b. Using css background image
    We can add an image as a background to a React component by using CSS styles.
    
    import React from "react";

    const App = () => {
        return (
            <>
                <div style={{backgroundImage : 'url(image.jpg)'}} />
            </>
        )
    }

    export default App;

    c. Importing image as an modules

     import React from "react";
     import Image from "./constant";

     const App = () => {
        return (
            <>
                <img src={Image} />
            </>
        )
     } 

     export default App;

2. What would happen if we use console.log(useState())?
- it will return an array of length 2. 
    [undefined, function]
first will be default value passed with useState as an argument and second will be function.

3. How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array?
- It will trigger after every render

useEffect(()=> {
    console.log("useEffect")
});

4. What is SPA?
- SPA stands for single page application. It is a implementation of web application that loads a single
web document. It allows user to route the page without reloading the whole page.

5. Difference between client side routing and server side routing?
- server side routing keeps making request to the server in order for the apllication to rerender.

client side routing does not need to keep making request to the server, it does it once when the application
is being loaded into the browser any other navigation or page change is just being rendered from the 
already saved application.
