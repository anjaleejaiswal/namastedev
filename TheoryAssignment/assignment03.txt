1. What is JSX?
It is React extension which allows writing javascript code that looks like HTML.

Ex-
function HeaderComponent() => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Namate React</h1>
        </div>
    )
}

2. Superpowers of JSX?
a. It prevents injection attacks XSS(cross-site-scripting). Hence, it is very secure.
b. JSX can easily convert HTML tags to react elements. It is faster than regular JavaScript.
