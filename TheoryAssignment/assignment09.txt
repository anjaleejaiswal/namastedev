1. When and why do we need lazy()? 
- We use lazy loading only when large file size in our app. 
If our app size is bigger and if we load all the data at the same time it will slow down the performance 
of the app and soemtimes our crashes too.
To overcome this issue we use lazy loading means we will load only that things which is needed at the time.

2. What is suspense?
- when we are loading component on demand react suspense this.
Suspense component allow us to show some fallback content(loader/ shimmer UI) while we're waiting 
for the lazy component to load or the component is not yet rendered.

import React, {Suspense, lazy} from "react";
import Shimmer from './Shimmer';

const About = lazy(()=> import('./About'));

const Applayout = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <Suspense fallback={<Shimmer />}>
                <About />
            </Suspense>
        </>
    )
}

3. Why we got this error : A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will
cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator.To fix, update the suspend should be wrapped with 
startTarnsition? How does suspense fix this error?

This error is thrown as exception by React when the promise to dynamically import the lazy component is not yet
resolved and the component is expected to render in the meantime. If only the dynamic import is done and
there is no <Suspense /> component then this error is shown. React expects a suspense boundaryto be in place
for showing the fallbackprop until the promise is getting resolved.
If showing the  shimmer is not desirable in some situation, then startTransitions API can be used to show the
old UI while new UI is being prepared. React do this without having to delete or remove the suspense component
or its props from your code.

4. Advantages and disadvantages of using this code splitting pattern?
- Advantages;
a. Redues the page load time by bundling the large codes into smaller bundles and loading dynamically only 
when component is loaded.
b. Initial page load time also improved.
c.Improves user experience during loaded by showing showing fallback UI using Suspense component.

disadvantages:
a. though initila load time is reduced but it increase load time each component when it loaded dynamically.
b. many http request when component is loaded dynamically.

5. When do we and why do we need suspense?
-Suspense component allow us to show some fallback content(loader/ shimmer UI) while we're waiting 
for the lazy component to load or the component is not yet rendered.
