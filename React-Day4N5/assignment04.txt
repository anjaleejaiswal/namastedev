3. {TitleComponent} vs <TitleComponent /> vs <TitleComponent></TitleComponent> in JSX?
{TitleComponent} - TitleComponent as a javascript expression or a variable. The {} can embed a 
javascript expression or a variable inside it.
<TitleComponent /> - represent a component returning some JSX value.
                    In simple word TitleComponent is a function returning some JSX value.
                    Component is written inside the < /> expression.
<TitleComponent><TitleComponent /> - <TitleComponent><TitleComponent /> and <TitleComponent /> are 
                                    equivalent only whereas  <TitleComponent /> has no child component 
                                    and  <TitleComponent><TitleComponent />  created to include the
                                    child component.

8. Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?
Let's suppose if we have 4 div (a,b,c,d) and later on we have added one more div (e,a,b,c,d)
so react doesn't know the order they were actually present. So it will re-render everything.
If we add key which makes it unique so React will get to know about "e" div came up later and
it will re-render only that one which is required.

9. Can we use index as keys in React?
Yes we can use index but React uses keys attribute to track the changes in the list.

We might face following issues when we use index as key attribute when creating a list:

Perfomance issue due to unecessary re-renders.
Issue in data mapping in case list items are sorted, filtered or deleted.
