1. What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * export?
Named Export - 
export without default tag is Named Export. A module can have multiple named exports.
which are simply variables or functions that are marked for export with export keyword.

export const NameOfComponent = () => {console.log("Hello")};
export const variableName = "Hello1"

want to import named component: 

import {NameOfComponent} from "./Component.js";

* exports - 
alternatively we can also use import keyword with the * symbol to import all named exports from
a module into a single object and then access the named exports using the corresping names.

import * as Obj from "./Component.js";

console.log(Obj.NameOfComponent); //Hello
console.log(Obj.variableName); //Hello1

Default Export -
export with default tag is Default Export.A Module can have only one default export. 

const DefaultComponent = () => {};
export default DefaultComponent;

while importing default component:
import DefaultComponent from "./DefaultComponent.js"
